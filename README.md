# RealFizzBuzz2
Step 2:
Enhance your existing FizzBuzz solution to perform the following:
1. If the number contains a three you must output the text 'lucky'. This overrides any
existing behaviour
e.g. if I run the program over a range from 1-20 I should get the following output:
1. 1 2 lucky 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz lucky 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz
Upload the source code to github as a separate project and provide the link to the repository
